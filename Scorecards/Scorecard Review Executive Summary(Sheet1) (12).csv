We also reviewed 21 logbook corrections, which is below the threshold of 35 and consisted mostly of internally corrected items with no deviations. The SBM Quality team will be on-site during the week of 11/10 to continue improvement efforts.

CBRE acknowledged positive progress in audits and reductions in complaints. They requested that SBM submit Report-Its for marked conference and huddle room walls that fall outside of cleaning scope.
